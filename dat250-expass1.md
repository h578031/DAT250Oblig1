# DAT250 Assignment 1

## Software installation

The first part of the assignment was to install:
* JDK
* An IDE
* Maven
* Git client

Luckily I already had all of them installed prior to the assignment so there was nothing to do in this step. 

## Deploying java application to Heroku

In this part I followed the **Getting started on Heroku with java** tutorial. The tutorial went trough how to deploy an example java project and had very clear instructions
so I really had no problems with following the steps. One concept I struggled to understand however was *One-off dynos* (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/one-off-dynos#timeout-awaiting-processhttps://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/one-off-dynos#timeout-awaiting-process) but after reading about it a little more I understood.

I choose not to do the *Provision add-ons* step since it required account verification.
