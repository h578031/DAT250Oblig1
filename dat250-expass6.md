# DAT250 Expass 6

I had no technical problems during the completion of the turorials

## Ex 1: Spring Boot MVC

In the first exercise I made a GreetingController that returned a view which displayed * Hello world * or * Hello {name} * 
I also added an index.html file that was displayed when requesting localhost:8080.

## Ex 2: React turorial

The react tutorial was more fun to complete. The goal was to create a tic-tac-toe game and went trough lots of important concepts within react.
