# DAT250 Assignment 2

## Experiment 1

The first challenge I encountered was how to open a project in IntelliJ as a maven project, but I found out quickly that I only 
needed to open the "pom.xml" to correctly get a maven project. After I changed the path in * persistance.xml * the main method ran without any errors. 
I struggled a little bit about how to inspect the database tables but I first installed the * Derby database server * locally and used the SQL scripting tool "ij" 
that came together with Derby. I did not really like ij so I connected to the database using DBeaver instead ( I also found out that IntelliJ has an integrated database tool, 
but I still prefer DBeaver).
