# Assignment 5


I did not really have any tecnical problems so there is not too much to write about. 

## Ex 1

In the first exercise I used the * Spring initializr * to generate a new spring boot project, after that I added the hello method that made an endpoint at /hello and then I ran 
the project to make sure that it worked.

## Ex 2
In the second exercise I continued in the same project as ex 1 and added HelloController and an Application class. When I ran the project it printed out all the beans that were created by the application. 

## Ex 3

In the third exercise the goal was to make a RestAPI. I started by creating a Greeting * model * that contained id and content. Afterwards I created the GreetingController that had a get method that would return a Greeting object.

## Ex 4

The final guide was about how to access data with JPA, there was an entity class called Customer and a Main class that persisted 5 customers and used findById and findByLastName methods to return customers.
